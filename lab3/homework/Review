#1. Why should we use functions at all?
    Because of reusability of functions

#2. How to define/declare a function?
    A function is defined by double parentheses
    e.g: print()

#3. How to call/use a function?
    e.g:

    def sum():              #declare a function
        s = a + b
        print(s)
    sum()                   #call the function

#4. What is return, why and how do we use it?
    _ The return statement causes your function to exit and hand back a value to its caller
    _ The return statement is used when a function is ready to return a value to its caller
    _ e.g:
    
    def sum():             
        s = a + b
        return(s)
    
    and then we can use s in expressions, just like math

#5. Do we have to use return in every function?
    No

#6. What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?
    _ That is often used to refer to the variable as found in the function definition
    _e.g:
     
    def sum(4, 5):             
        s = a + b

#7. How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
    Create a link from currently working file to the file which needed relate
    Use form: from <linked file> import <linked function>
